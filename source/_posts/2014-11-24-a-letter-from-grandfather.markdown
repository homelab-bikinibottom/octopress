I was doing backup of some files and found a snapshot of this particular letter in my disk. As slong I remember, it was from a magazine that I read at home, and I found this message was quite interesting. I did Google to find out the complete letter of the writer: James K. Flanagan. He was a vice president of research department of Rutgers University, USA. He wrote this letter to his five grandchildrens, months earlier before he got a heart attack and died. You might want to read the full letter [here](http://s.eamca.com/grandfathers-love).

Rest in peace, Mr Flanagan.
